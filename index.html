                <h2> About me</h2> 
                <p> My name is Iliana and I come from a small country in Europe, where I grew up somewhere between old traditions and industrialization attempts. I have always lived in a big city, but my grandma never has. This is why, even though modernized, I still have access to valuable information about real food that our grandparents once had.<br><br> 
Growing up in a big city, I ate what a typical modern child would eat: potato chips, chocolate croissants and candy. However, I was not allowed to eat lollipops (which means that I regulary manipulated my grandpa when he came to see me to get me some, telling him that I was allowed to eat them :D), artificially sweetened foods and drinks, cheap chocolate and many others. We have always cooked at home from scratch, and I have no idea how pancakes from a box taste. I have no idea how you prepare beans from alluminium cans, as we never bought such. I have no idea how Sprite tastes and I have never tried Burger King hamburgers. This whole process taught me how delicious real food is and how easy it is to cook from scratch! On this website you will find delicious recipes, ranging from Paleo to Vegan, that share several common features: All of them are delicious, easy to make and healthy!
