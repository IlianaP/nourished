                        <p>3 cups raw buckwheat</p>
                        <p>Maple syrup or honey or raw coconut nectar to taste</p> 
                        <p>Fresh lemon juice (optional)</p>
                        <p>1/3 tablespoon or more cinnamon</p>
                        <p>Salt to taste (optional)</p>

                        <h2>Steps</h2> 
                        <p>1. Soak the buckwheat overnight in a large bowl and cover with something. Remember that the buckwheat will absorb the water, so add plenty of water.
 </p> 
                        <p>2. 12 hours later, rinse the buckwheat well.</p>
                        <p>3. Take a strainer and fill it. Place it over a bowl, but make sure the water doesn't touch the buckwheat. Cover with something.</p> 
                        <p>4.You must keep the buckwheat moist, so every 3-6 hours rinse the buckwheat, depending on your the humidity of your home).</p> 
                        <p>5.Continue doing it for at least 24 hours.</p> 
                        <p>6.After that, rinse the buckwheat and put into a large bowl. Add the other ingredients and mix well.</p> 
                        <p>7.Spread the buckwheat on a baking sheet and "bake them" on the lowest temperature for at least 5 hours or until crispy. I baked mine at 30˚C-40˚C for 8 hours.</p> 
                        <p>8.Store in the fridge and enjoy them with some kind of milk or plain.</p>
