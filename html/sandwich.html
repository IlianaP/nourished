                        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <h4>For the cookies:</h4>
                        <p>1/2 cup coconut oil </p>
                        <p>1 cup whole wheat flour </p>
                        <p> 3 teaspoons honey (if not, substitute for 1/2 brown sugar or something else)</p>
                        <p>1 1/2 Tbsp freshly ground flax seeds</p>
                        <p> 1/2 tablespoon baking soda</p> 
                        <p>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</p> 
                        <p> Salt to taste</p>
                        <p>2 tablespoons water or vegan milk</p>
                        <p>+1/2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</p>
                        <h4>For the banana ice cream:</h4> 
                        <p>3 normal bananas (frozen)</p> 
                        <p>Cacao (optional)</p>
                        <p>Other ingredients like coconut etc. (optional)</p>
                    </div> 
                    <div id="recipeboxright"> 
                        <h2>Steps</h2> 
                        <p> 1. Put the bananas into the freezer until really hard.</p>
                        <p>2. Preheat the oven to 200&#8451;/400&#8457;.</p>
                        <p>3. Meanwhile, prepare the cookies: Combine the flour, salt. </p> 
                        <p>4. Grind your flax seeds in a seed grinder or coffee grinder. Add them to the dry bowl. </p>
                        <p>5. In another small bowl combine the baking soda and the 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (bubbles :D). Wait until the bubbles are away and add to the flour. Mix well. </p> 
                        <p>6. In another bowl add the coconut oil and honey and water. Mix well and add in the main bowl. (Make sure all ingredients have a room temperature)</p>
                        <p>7. Stir well until you have a wet thick yet oily dough. Fold in the vinegar.</p> 
                        <p>8. Put it in the refrigerator until it becomes sticky and easy to form (about 10 minutes)</p>
                        <p>9. Make your own cookies and place them in the oven.</p> 
                        <p>10. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown.
The cookies will be very soft when you take them out. Wait a little bit before you eat them. </p> 
                        <h2>The ice cream: </h2>
                        <p>1. Take the bananas out of the freezer and put them into a food processor. Blend until ice cream forms and add any ingredients you want: coconut, sugar, cacao etc.</p> 
                        <p>2. Place the ice cream on a baking sheet and make a thin rectangle out of it. Place in the freezer until hard.</p>               
                        <p>3. After the ice cream is ready, take it out and cut exactly the same shapes.</p> 
                        <p>4. Use 2 cookies and one ice cream shape to make the sandwiches and put them back into the freezer for 10 mintes, after which you can serve them.</p> 
                        <p>Enjoy! </p>
